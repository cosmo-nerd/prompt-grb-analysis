# 🔭 Bangs, Blips and Background: Decoding GRB Signals

This project implements a pipeline to detect and classify Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) from AstroSat-CZTI data using statistical methods and signal processing techniques. It distinguishes astrophysical transients from background noise and charged particle hits, establishing a framework for reliable GRB detection and analysis.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `1_GRB_detection.ipynb`  
  Constructs light curves from AstroSat CZTI data and applies multiple detrending filters (Savitzky-Golay, Median, Wavelet) to highlight potential transient features.

- `2_pipeline.ipynb`  
  Performs peak detection using SNR analysis and n-sigma thresholding, followed by spectrogram generation and classification of events into:
  - **Bang (GRB)**
  - **Blip (charged particle)**
  - **Background (noise)**

## 🧪 Methods Overview

### 📈 Data Processing
- Raw CZTI quadrant and veto data parsed from `.evt` FITS files using `astropy`.
- Binned into 1s and 10s light curves across multiple energy bands (20–500 keV).

### 🧹 Detrending
Applied and compared:
- **Savitzky-Golay filtering** (unsuitable due to peak smoothing)
- **Median filtering** (best performance for impulsive events)
- **Wavelet denoising** (balanced suppression but slightly smoothed peaks)
- **Matched filtering** (template mismatch issues for GRBs)

### 📌 Peak Detection
- Used SNR calculation and **5σ thresholding** to identify statistically significant events.
- Spectrograms and energy-profile plots validate astrophysical signatures.

### 🚦 Classification Logic
1. **Bang (GRB)**: Multi-quadrant, multi-band, >5σ, power-law energy profile.
2. **Blip (Particle)**: Localized spike in one band/quadrant, 3σ–5σ range.
3. **Background**: Instrumental artifacts, noise, or post-SAA glitches.

## 🛰 Instrument: AstroSat-CZTI

The Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) onboard AstroSat (India’s first space observatory) operates in the 20–200 keV range with a wide field-of-view. Its veto detectors (100–500 keV) help eliminate cosmic ray contamination. The data are quadrant-resolved and sensitive to GRBs both on- and off-axis.
